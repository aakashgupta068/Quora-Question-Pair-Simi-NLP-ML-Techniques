# Quora-Question-Pair Similarity-NLP-Machine Learning-Techniques
The goal of this competition is to predict which of the provided pairs of questions contain two questions with the same meaning. Suppose you ask a question on Quora, and get some suggested answers. These answers corrosponds to questions which are similar to the one you have asked.

#### My Opinion:
- If you get suggested wrong answers, then it is more damaging to the end-user, than compared to the situation where Quora Model is unable to suggest available answers to already asked similar questions. 

#### Hence, we should penalise the model more if it misclassifies a Question as Duplicate, i.e., False Positives as compared to miss-classified as Not-Duplicate
